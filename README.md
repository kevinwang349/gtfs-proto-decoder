# gtfs-proto-decoder
Decodes GTFS-realtime protocol buffers. Much of the protocol-buffer decoder can also be modified to process other protocol buffers.

protodecoder.js contains the decoder code. gtfs-realtime-proto.txt is the .proto file for a GTFS-realtime protocol buffer, which isn't used in the code but is useful for formatting. The code itself uses a hardcoded JSON object as a format.
